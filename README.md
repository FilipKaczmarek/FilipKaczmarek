Thank you for taking the time to visit my GitHub profile. I would like to introduce myself and tell you about some of the interesting things I do. <br/>
So, My name is Filip but you can call me Feli. I'm 24 years old and I currently live in Warsaw. However, in a few years, I'd like to move to the Netherlands.<br/>
First of all, I'm an IT Recruiter who works for BeeTalents, one of the best IT Recruitment Agencies in Poland! Sounds cool, right? </br></br>
I'm also a Junior Front-end Developer. I fell in love with web development in the beginning of 2020. I taught myself everything I know, by taking online courses at Udemy. When I am not creating websites, you can find me in the gym or taking bike rides around the city. </br></br>
Another one of my hobbies is creating episodes for my podcast, RaczkujÄ™ w HaeRach, about the HR industry, and you can listen to them on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0isj3lyvqlXFniLlBBg0sV?si=5dvxjv_3S_GguNwV6g4QnA">Spotify</a> or <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/raczkuje-w-haerach/id1493457526">iTunes</a>. Be aware! It's in polish (my mother tongue) and we know how weird polish can be.
